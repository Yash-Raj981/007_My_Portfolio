# 🔑 Personal Portfolio

It's my Personal Portfolio Website. I made it by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some libraries of JS like Typed, etc. I took reference for UI design from a Youtube video but I have added many functionalities which a single person can't perceive in a single go. You can visite this website and explore about me.
